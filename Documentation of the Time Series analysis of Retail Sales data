# Documentation of the Time Series analysis of Retail Sales data

1. Trending the data
  1.1 Simple trends: To profile and understand data
      * Monthly trend: Shown in Figure 1: Monthly Trend of Retail and Food Service sales. This data clearly has some patterns, but also has some noice.
      * Using the date_part function to return just the year from sales_month field and then sum sales. The results are again filtered to kind of business = Retail and food services sales
      * So we have a smoother time series that is increasing over time (as expected because the sales values are not adjusted for inflation)
      * Sales for etail and Food Service sales fell in 2009, during the global financial crisis in US.
      * Then growing and sales were flat in 2020 compared to 2019, due to impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, also shown in Figure 2.
  1.2 Comparing components
      * SALES OF SPORTING GOODS, BOOK STORES, HOOBY/TOY & GAMES STORES (leisure  activities) 
      * The results are graphed in Figure 3.
      * Sales of sporting goods are highest among three categories (book stores, sporting, hobby/toy and games stores)
      * Sales at sporting good stores started declining in 2017 but had a big rebound in 2020.
      * Sales at hobby, toy, and game stores remained largely stable over the period, showing only minor fluctuations. 
        There was a small decline in the mid-2000s and another soft dip just before 2020, followed by a noticeable rebound in 2020.
      * Book store sales showed a clear rise through the late 1990s and early 2000s, reaching their peak in the mid-2000s. 
        After that point, the trend shifted, with sales gradually declining year after year, reflecting a longer-term change in how consumers discover and purchase books.
      * While all of these retail categories have felt the impact of the rise of online retailers, the effects did not arrive all at once or with the same intensity. 
      * SALES OF WOMEN's and MEN's CLOTHING STORES
